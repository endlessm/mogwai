.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.\"
\fBmogwai\-scheduled [\-a \fPbus\-address\fB]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP is a scheduler for large downloads. It receives requests
for starting downloads from various client programs, schedules them according
to current bandwidth and cost limitations, and notifies the client programs when
to download (and how much to download). It is up to each client program to
decide what a ‘large’ download is, and whether it would benefit from scheduling
with \fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP.
.PP
\fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP is designed to be run by \fBsystemd\fP(1), being
D\-Bus activated. There should be no need to run \fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP
manually. Use \fBmogwai\-schedule\-client\fP(8) to schedule downloads from the
command line.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS

.\"
.IP "\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-inactivity\-timeout=\fP"
Inactivity timeout (in milliseconds) to wait before exiting the service if no
scheduling requests have been made during that period. If set to \fB0\fP, the
