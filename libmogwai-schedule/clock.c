 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: libmogwai-schedule/clock.h
 *
 * #MwsClock is an interface to wall clock timing and alarm functionality, and
 * is provided as an abstraction over the standard system clock functions. By
 * abstracting timing, unit tests can test timing-specific behaviour without
 * having to use multi-hour sleeps or being subject to race conditions.
 *
 * The typical runtime implementation of this interface is #MwsClockSystem,
 * which uses the system clock.
 *
 * A typical test implementation of this interface is #MwsClockDummy, which
 * allows its time and timezone to be controlled by the calling test harness.
 *
 * Since: 0.1.0
