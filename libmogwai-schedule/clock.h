/**
 * MwsClockInterface:
 * @g_iface: parent interface
 * @get_now_local: (not nullable): Get the current time, in the local timezone.
 *    This method must be implemented.
 * @add_alarm: (not nullable): Add a callback to be invoked when @alarm_time is
 *    reached. If  @alarm_time is now or in the past, the callback must be
 *    invoked immediately. This method must be implemented.
 * @remove_alarm: (not nullable): Remove a pending alarm using the ID returned
 *    by @add_alarm. If the alarm callback has already been invoked, this should
 *    emit a critical warning. This method must be implemented.
 *
 * An interface which provides wall clock timing and alarm functions to callers.
 * The standard implementation is #MwsClockSystem, which uses the system clock.
 * Other implementations may be available, which use mock data for testing.
 *
 * All virtual methods in this interface are mandatory to implement if the
 * interface is implemented.
 *
 * Since: 0.1.0
