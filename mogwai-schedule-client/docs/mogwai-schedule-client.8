.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBmogwai\-schedule\-client\fP is a utility for scheduling and downloading large
files. It communicates with \fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP(8) to work out when to start
downloading the given file in order to avoid bandwidth charges. That might be
as soon as \fBmogwai\-schedule\-client\fP is started, or it might be hours
later; the client blocks until the download is started and complete.
