Mogwai
======

Mogwai allows systems to take advantage of reduced cost bandwidth at off-peak
times of day. It provides a monitoring daemon which checks bandwidth usage, a
scheduling daemon which prioritises downloads to minimise cost, and a tariff
library which describes different data plans.

All the library APIs are currently unstable and are likely to change wildly.

Dependencies
============

 • glib-2.0 ≥ 2.44.0
 • gio-2.0 ≥ 2.44.0

Licensing
=========

The daemon components of Mogwai are licensed under the LGPL. The libraries are
also licensed under the LGPL. See COPYING for more details.

Bugs
====

Bug reports and patches should be reported by e-mail to one of the authors.
