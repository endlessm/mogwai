Mogwai
======

Mogwai allows systems to take advantage of reduced cost bandwidth at off-peak
times of day. It provides a monitoring daemon which checks bandwidth usage, a
scheduling daemon which prioritises downloads to minimise cost, and a tariff
library which describes different data plans.

All the library APIs are currently unstable and are likely to change wildly.
